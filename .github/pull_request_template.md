What testing have you done?

<!--
Automated tests are expected with every code change.

For UI changes, include tests for the accessibility of elements. This can include:
* Run the application locally with accessibility features such as VoiceOver/TalkBack enabled.
* Write UI tests that find elements by their accessible label
    * assert that elements have the expected properties - isEnabled, isSelected, etc.
* Run accessibility audit using XCode Accessibility Inspector or Android Accessibility Scanner
