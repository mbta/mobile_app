/**
 * When part of a subway line is closed, should the headsign be the temporary terminal or the
 * permanent terminal? There is no obviously correct answer - temporary terminals directly
 * communicate the boundaries of a disruption, but permanent terminals match in-station wayfinding
 * and are more clearly aligned with directions for riders unfamiliar with the system.
 *
 * The data we receive is inconsistent: depending on numerous factors upstream, schedules may or may
 * not contain temporary terminals, and if they do, predictions may or may not match them. In the
 * medium term, we expect to predictably receive permanent terminals as headsigns, but in the short
 * term, we need some way to avoid confusion in the presence of inconsistent data.
 *
 * Rewriting predictions to have different headsigns and route patterns was a mess when we tried it
 * previously, so we always keep predictions as-is, whether they show permanent terminals or
 * temporary, and if the schedules disagree, we erase the scheduled headsign. Since we don't show
 * scheduled times on subway, the hidden schedule headsign would only ever be shown with
 * "Predictions unavailable", so no actual data will be lost.
